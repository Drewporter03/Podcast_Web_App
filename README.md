# ðŸŽ§ Podcast Web Application

A Flask-based platform for browsing, managing, and testing podcast data.

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application developed with Flask and Python, designed to manage podcast data, perform CRUD operations, and demonstrate clean software architecture using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

It features a structured domain model, automated unit testing, and dynamic HTML rendering via Jinja2 templates. Originally developed as part of a university project, it has been expanded and refined to highlight practical software engineering principles.

## Features

Podcast Management â€” Create, read, update, and delete podcast data entries.

Domain Modeling â€” Structured object-oriented design representing podcasts, episodes, and creators.

Dynamic Rendering â€” Jinja2 templates for rendering domain objects as interactive HTML pages.

Testing Suite â€” Automated testing framework using pytest to ensure code reliability.

Environment Configuration â€” Uses .env variables for development and production separation.
